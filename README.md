# Hi there 👋

My name is Thijs Franck, and I'm a professional software developer from the Netherlands 🇳🇱. Welcome to my repository, where I showcase a diverse collection of my personal projects. 

I am passionate about open source, and all my projects are released under the MIT license. Feel free to explore my published [packages and containers](https://github.com/thijsfranck?tab=packages) 📦. If you find them useful and decide to use any, I would be thrilled to hear about your experience and learn from it ❤️.

## How to reach out

Besides coding, I enjoy sharing my insights and experiences. My blog, _Thoughtstream_, is where I muse on everything from solution architecture to in-depth technology discussions.
